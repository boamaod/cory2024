Cory Doctorow has been a significant figure in shaping information
policy debates worldwide, alongside respected peers such as Richard
Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Lawrence Lessig, and Jon 'Maddog' Hall.

Besides decades long policy work at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and being Visiting Professor of Computer Science at Open University UK, he is a renowned science fiction writer. In this role he is giving a public talk on [Overcoming the Enshittocene](https://kirjandusfestival.tartu.ee/en/performers/cory-doctorow-usa/) at Prima Vista literary festival on May 8th.

We are excited to host him two days later at the Institute of Computer Science to continue the discussion and to ask questions.

Cory Doctorow will introduce the topic once again in a short talk about the _four forces_ that keep tech companies from abusing us --- competition, regulation, interoperability and an empowered tech workforce. The discussion following the talk is moderated by [Ulrich Norbisrath](https://ulno.net/) and you can send your questions in advance to [askcory@infoaed.ee](mailto:askcory@infoaed.ee).

The title of the discussion _Seizing the Means of Computation_ is a subtitle of Doctorow's latest non-fiction book [The Internet Con](https://craphound.com/internetcon/) as well as the remedy proposed at the last part of his Prima Vista talk.
