It is hard to overestimate Cory Doctorow's influence on information policy debates around the world --- although younger, he can be considered in the same league with Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds and Lawrence Lessig.

Besides decades long policy work at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and being Professor of Computer Science at Open University UK, he is a renowned science fiction writer. In this role he is giving a public talk on [Overcoming the Enshittocene](https://kirjandusfestival.tartu.ee/en/performers/cory-doctorow-usa/) at Prima Vista literary festival on May 8th.

We are excited to host him two days later at the Institute of Computer Science to continue the discussion and ask questions.

Professor Doctorow will introduce the topic once again in a short talk about _four forces_ that keep tech companies from abusing us --- competition, regulation, interoperability and empowered tech workforce. The following discussion is moderated by [Ulrich Norbisrath](https://ulno.net/) and you can send your questions in advance to [askcory@infoaed.ee](mailto:askcory@infoaed.ee).

The title of the discussion _Seizing the Means of Computation_ is a subtitle of Cory Doctorow's latest non-fiction book [The Internet Con](https://craphound.com/internetcon/) as well as the remedy proposed at the last part of his Prima Vista talk.
